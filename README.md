# EZGUI

Ever been too confused by ImGui's setup? Want to make a quick config GUI for your project? Too lazy to figure out how standalone platform windows work?

EZGUI abstracts away the setup and provides a pretty simple interface for creating a GUI. If you need any more customization, I
highly encourage you to use ImGui directly - but this is good for use cases where you just need a window fast.

## Dependencies

ImGui, OpenGL3, and SDL2 are required.

## Usage

Documentation coming soon! For now, check out the demo in `demo.cpp`.
